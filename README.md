# StupidHttpServerPy
` A stupid and useless HTTP server written in Python using Sockets, entirely for learning purposes. It can handle GET requests (which is kinda hardcoded) and can display html, text and jpeg images.
Not completely useless as I might use this instead of SimpleHTTPServer, just for the sake of it.
